# DQ
A deque-based programming language
Inspired in [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth) and the [deque.py](https://github.com/tsoding/deque.py) project.

# Quick Start
```console
$ ./main.py hello.dq
```

# Language Basics

`5 write`

Add numbers:
`5 5 + write`

Subtract numbers:
`6 5 - write`

Print hex values:
`0x6869 hwrite`
# Language Plans
+ Compiled
  - To native code
  - To other compiled language
+ Readability
+ String parsing
